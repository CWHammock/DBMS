Assumption for movie database:

1. There are not two production companies with same name.
2. There are not two actors/directors born on same day and share same name.
3. There are not two movies with same name and year released. 

Some other considerations:

1. I was unsure if the ISA relationship (generalization) was suppose to be shown in the diagram or in a seperate box as shown in the powerpoints.
